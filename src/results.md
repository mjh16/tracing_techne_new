## Topic Models Invention and _Techne_
For this project I developed topics models for the entire corpus and for a subset of documents that had an explicit mention of invention, as I was interested in the rhetorical cannon of invention.

Through modeling and tracing the corpus, I found *techne* throughout the scholarship of the 1990s with 58 explicit instances of the string of letters “techne” being found within the full text of the corpus. Many of these articles deal with specific recoveries of rhetorical theory or action, often undertaken to apply a past theory to a technological composition issue such as the use of word processors. An example of this type of article is Keith Dorwick’s “Rethinking the Academy: Problems and Possibilities of Teaching, Scholarship, Authority, and Power in Electronic Environments.” Others focus on a specific classical rhetorical theory or theorist with a focus on reconceptualizing or reconsidering that theory in this specific context. For example Bruce McComiskey’s “Disassembling Plato's Critique of Rhetoric in the Gorgias (447a-466a)” and Ramsey Eric Ramsey’s “A Hybrid Technê of the Soul?: Thoughts on the Relation between Philosophy and Rhetoric in Gorgias and Phaedrus.” A third type of article with explicit mentions of *“*techne” involve specific writing praxis where fields of study such as professional writing are considered or issues of pedagogy are discussed. Some examples of these articles include Thomas P. Miller’s “Treating Professional Writing as Social Praxis” and Theresa L. Ebert’s “For a Red Pedagogy: Feminism, Desire, and Need.”

However, I am interested in where else assumptions and impressions of *techne* could be found within the corpus without the explicit appearance of the string of letters “techne.” This absence of *techne* would show up as “impressions” of *techne* in the topic models that I interpreted as a place where its not quite there but it could be read as aligning with a composite definition. These impressions of *techne* are embedded within other topics, such as creativity, social critique, and technology, and within documents with titles that would not indicate inclusions of a discussion regarding *techne*. 

I then worked to examine impressions of *techne* alongside explicit instances of the string “invention.” I chose the search “invention” due to my interest in the rhetorical cannon of invention given its strong historical and theoretical association with *techne*. This subset of the corpus resulted in 544 unique articles which included the string “invention” within the text in some fashion. I then generated a 50 topic models from this selection and interpreted 19 topics as aligning with a compound definition of *techne* in some way. The list of generated topics can be found in table 1.
