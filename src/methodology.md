## Data Feminism
Given a lack of direct discussion of *techne* and invention from scholarship of the 1990s, I turned to a data curation methodology which relies on data feminism, a term partially coined by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, which presents a set of seven data principles for a feminist data ethic: examine power, challenge power, elevate emotion and embodiment, rethink binaries and hierarchies, embrace pluralism, consider context, and make labor visible (2020). By approaching data as a feminist practice with rhetorical attitudes that resist closure and historical erasing, data curation focuses on differences and gaps and as Patricia Sullivan and Tarez Samra Graban argue, allows for a revisiting of views for “understanding of how groups of rare artifacts or texts could have functioned together more broadly” (Sullivan and Graban 2011, 7). 

Data curation builds from the following assumptions: that textual data analysis can be used to trace an absence of explicit discussion, that this tracing is a partial perspective, that tracing an intersection must account for difference, and that a re-seeing through curation and visualization can be used to make arguments about the current state of the discipline. Approaching data curation as an embodied historiographic process (Graban and Sullivan 2018, 189-207) that tells a story of the field’s communities through selected, visualized, and presented data and discourses, can be an important act of recovery through reconnecting information with bodies, data with discourse, and historicity with disciplinarity.
