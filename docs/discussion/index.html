    <h1>Discussion</h1>
    <h2>Invention and <em>Techne</em></h2>
<p>Tracing impressions of <em>techne</em> where they appear alongside explicit mentions of the strong “invention” paints a nuanced picture of the history of <em>techne</em> within topics explicitly aligned towards issues of rhetorical and technological invention. The topics identified have a number of readings concerned with the practical application of rhetoric suggesting a rich variety of scholarship that can be drawn upon when considering <em>techne</em> and invention. There are also trends in these impressions towards the use of particular resources, such as handbooks, when considering <em>techne</em> and the reconsidering of Ancient Greek and Roman rhetorical theory and practice. With these impressions there are three main findings. First, that these impressions largely support existing field histories. Second, histories of <em>techne</em> are carried out for two historiographic impulses in authorization and recovery. Third, that looking at impressions rather than direct theorization enriches rhetorical historiographic work.</p>
<p>First, this project supports the narrative of the 1990s as being primarily concerned with the issues of the social turn and postmodern critique, especially within dominant journals. Even when specialty concerns were brought up in more niche journals such as <em>JAEPL</em> and <em>Kairos</em>, they were framed within discussions of subjectivity, ideology, and social critique. Second, these tracings supports disciplinary histories such as Richard Fulkerson’s that point to continued professionalization and specialization of the field, with impressions of <em>techne</em> backing assumptions about the value of teaching and researching writing in particular contexts. However, <em>techne</em> was found as an impression within these professionalizing conversations and not as a primary area of historical focus. The continued specialization supports Lauer’s argument that invention scattered into a “diaspora of composition areas,” (2002, 2) where discussions of invention were contained within professionalizing focuses. The tracing of impressions of <em>techne</em> within the scholarship of the decade helped situate its obscured but important placement, and that it is historicized alongside other concerns.</p>
<p>Second, my study also suggests that histories of <em>techne</em> and invention have been largely undertaken for two historiographic impulses: authorization and recovery. First, as drawn from Ryan Skinnell, authorizing histories of <em>techne</em> framed an action, pedagogy, or epistemology within a tradition typically as a broadening narrative in the history rhetoric and composition, and to authorize some approach within that longer tradition (Skinnell 2015, 112). Authorizing histories of <em>techne</em> were most frequently found alongside discussions of invention and pedagogy and tended to feature topics that discussed the application of particular rhetorical theory and theorists.</p>
<p>For example, histories of authorization of <em>techne</em>, whether explicit or implied, provide a framework for contextualizing and historicizing a certain re-readings of historical figures and canonical texts for a basis of current action, evident in topics relating to Burke, Plato, Aristotle, and Habermas. In authorizing <em>techne</em>, documents such as “A Historicist Recontextualization of the Enthymeme” by Carol Poster re-situates uptakes of enthymemes and sophistic rhetoric for contemporary concerns. This, along with other authorizing narratives, connected theories and pedagogies to an intellectual history, building disciplinary legitimacy.</p>
<p>The second historiographic impulse of recovery ultimately has similar goals to those of authorization but, as Michelle Bailiff argues, they work towards an expansion of what counts for the discipline and as a history of rhetoric (Balliff 2012, 1). These histories of recovery included topics that aligned with particular traditions and figures, and tend to feature the redefining of theory through the recovery of a figure or tradition, often with broader rhetorical goals including expanding feminist rhetorics and the reclaiming the sophists. Histories of recovery of <em>techne</em> tended towards topics where a specific overlooked rhetor, text, or tradition is brought forward into contemporary scholarship to broaden what counts as history and what should be included within rhetoric. A salient example of this type of history is “Friendly Dress: A Disciplined Use” by Carol Mattingly which focuses on how female Quaker speakers used reporting on their appearance in newspapers as an intentional rhetorical strategy. This article is itself situated within a number of other articles recovering a variety of figures, and in turning towards overlooked rhetorical traditions and to frame current practices.</p>
<p>When modeling the corpus, both of these historiographies tended operate at two different levels, authorizing at a macro level which tends to examine major movements in order to make authorizing claims about the discipline as a whole, and recovery at a micro level that tends to examine the local and specific, looking to make smaller recoveries in support of marginalized traditions or an expansion of a local context. An examination of history through a trace of <em>techne</em> illustrates how historiographic impulses and scales operate for different purposes in the discipline and are often employed to address different question about the nature of invention and <em>techne</em>. While diffuse and obscured, there is an abundance of discussions around <em>techne</em> and invention that is often embedded within other conversations.</p>
<p>These two historiographies of authorization and recovery are contextualized within a discipline focused on social construction and critique in the 1990s. As Geoffrey Sirc laments, the 1990s were a decade of “conservative professionalism” (2002, 32) that focused on using the potentials of postmodernism and linguistic play to better critique others and to secure a spot within the academy instead of an opening up of possibilities after process in <em>techne</em>. With the importation of critical theory into rhetoric and composition, invention appeared to become buried under these critical perspectives which John Muckelbauer argues bridges postmodern and social concerns between creation and discovery (Muckelbauer 2008, 13). Tracing <em>techne</em> suggests approaching the diffusion of interests brought about by professionalization and specialization as an opportunity to theorize the distributed impacts and histories of <em>techne</em>, and to reevaluate the value that has been placed on invention within these contexts. This project considers a <em>techne</em> that is more enriched for uptake in disciplinary conversations, and the results suggest enriching our current histories. Both authorizing and recovering narratives are important for consideration within the histories of the discipline, and we might recoup histories of invention through tracing at both micro and macro scales.</p>
<h2>Data Curation</h2>
<p>Working with data from a rich textual data set such a disciplinary scholarship is a flattening move in that it reduces the rich content and context of articles into sets of words as topics. It also relies upon my own interpretation of those topics to derive meaning from them, because on their own all they reveal is statistical features of their appearance together. The data feminist principals of embrace pluralism, consider context, and make labor visible especially important in my performance of this methodology, reminding me to consider that the topic models are perspectives on the corpus, and are partial views, and to return to the underlying documents and narratives that are in conversation with the data. Furthermore, feminist data curation directs my attention towards issues of representation within data and encouraged me to look for places where impressions of techne can be found within the narratives of individuals and the recovery of voices that have been outside of the mainstream. I found that data curation encouraged me to use the data to support a multiplicity of positions and to seek impressions of techne within unexpected places.</p>
<p>Data curation helped me center the idea that I’m working with impressions, and that a more complete work through this history would rely upon more fine-grained and sustained analysis of the corpus and the types of texts that it represents. Data curation also encourages iterative reflection and a justification for choices and helped to account for the personal behind the data. I found that it helped to bridge between the two types of historiographies, recovery and authorization. One of the benefits of data curation is the ability and necessity of looking at things at multiple scales and perspectives at once which allows for the recovery of techne that had been obscured while also providing a narrative of authorization and continuity. This project also has implications for utilizing data curation for other types of digital humanities projects in rhetoric and composition. Data curation also offers a methodological intervention for historiography by offering a means of using computational visualization and big-data tools in the work of tracing and using data alongside narratives to craft history. A critical stance is necessary with this approach, and data curation is rooted in a feminist data ethic that first questions the role of people in the creation and application of data. I see data curation as being a valuable methodological intervention for the discipline where tracing of difficult concepts in a large textual dataset could be useful. It offers a set of perspectives and critical questions that can be usefully applied in a variety of contexts. I think that it also has implications for how we might consider the teaching of complex and diffuse concepts within rhetoric and composition and could be useful in a number of educational contexts through making implicit knowledge explicit for students in rhetoric and composition.</p>
