    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The 2018 publication of <em>Composition, Rhetoric, and Disciplinarity</em> marks a recently renewed attempt to identify and qualify the contemporary social moment in rhetoric and composition (Malenczyk et al, 2018.). Part of the commonality that binds rhetoric and composition together in our contemporary moment, as Malenczyk et al describe it, is a devotion to pedagogy and an orientation toward service defined by inquiry into manifestations of language in this thing we call writing that make it look different from other disciplines (2018, 4-5). In that publication, what Malenczyk et al call a “disciplinary” turn  invites a critical examination of the field’s history. As a collection, Composition, Rhetoric, and Disciplinarity draws attention to the assumptions and work of the field of rhetoric and composition and, in doing so, asks us to re-examine the foundations of what it means to study writing.</p>
<p>We also find ourselves wrestling as a field with generative AI and the effects of large language models on writing pedagogy and theory. When a machine learning algorithm creates a-rhetorical hallucinations, with a great deal of clarity, something that sounds and looks a lot writing, it begs the question what is writing? Combined with disciplinary pressures to claim expertise over a domain of knowledge, it is important to return to what we mean when we consider techne and the relationships of techne to writing theory and practice. The end product, while important rhetorically, is not what writing is or is about. We value the thinking, learning, process, technology, social relationships, and cultures of writing. It is about how this activity is used and shared with other people. Historiographically interrogation techne suggests ways in which might start to re-situate processes and pedagogies in response to this moment.</p>
<p>I found the 1990s interesting for its lasting influence on questions of disciplinarity and rhetorical conceptions of writing in curriculums and pedagogy. Looking back at the 1990s with its influence of another major turn, the so-called “social” turn of the 1980s (Trimbur 1994, 109), and the importing of computerized technology into the teaching of writing, invites a recouping of techne for use in our current moment. I was particularly interested in that ambiguous space where writing gets started, those inventive and creative moments. I set out on a historiographic project that was interested in the interactions of invention, creativity, and text-technologies and the influence of 1990s scholarship on current theories and practices. So, I set out to do some searches in academic databases such as <em>CompPile</em>, <em>JSTOR</em>, and <em>Ebscohost</em>. What I found was the same issues that Janet Atwil and Janice Lauer noted in their introduction to Perspectives on Rhetorical Invention. What I found was techne, and that in the 1990s, that just like theories of invention techne was everywhere and nowhere.</p>
<p>Invention is a concept that is central to rhetorical theory and practice and plays a formative role in the composition pedagogies (Lauer 2004, 1). Invention was central to Richard Young’s 1978 conception of a paradigm of process around which to construct the teaching and research of composition. More specifically, the naming of a disciplinary turn invites us to chart the multiple trajectories and definitions of invention, given the prevalence and diffusion of invention scholarship during historiographic and professionalizing contexts of the 1990s which may bring other disciplinary tensions into focus. It also invites re-theorizing invention for creative pedagogies which bring together the personal, where techne connects processes of invention to processes of creating discourse. This moment of critical reflection, in turn, invites an examination of historiographic assumptions around techne, interrogating the published record for how that history has been formed and circulated for current pedagogies and theories.</p>
