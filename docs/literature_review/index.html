    <h1>Literature Review</h1>
    <p>The 2018 publication of <em>Composition, Rhetoric, and Disciplinarity</em> marks a recently renewed attempt to identify and qualify the contemporary social moment in rhetoric and composition (Malenczyk et al, 2018.). Part of the commonality that binds rhetoric and composition together in our contemporary moment, as Malenczyk et al describe it, is a devotion to pedagogy and an orientation toward service defined by inquiry into manifestations of language in this thing we call writing that make it look different from other disciplines (2018, 4-5). In that publication, what Malenczyk et al call a “disciplinary” turn  invites a critical examination of the field’s history. As a collection, <em>Composition, Rhetoric, and Disciplinarity</em> draws attention to the assumptions and work of the field of rhetoric and composition and, in doing so, asks us to re-examine the foundations of what it means to study writing.</p>
<h2>Invention</h2>
<p>Invention is a concept that is central to rhetorical theory and practice and plays a formative role in the composition pedagogies (Lauer 2004, 1). Invention was central to Richard Young’s 1978 conception of a paradigm of process around which to construct the teaching and research of composition. More specifically, the naming of a disciplinary turn invites us to chart the multiple trajectories and definitions of invention, given the prevalence and diffusion of invention scholarship during historiographic and professionalizing contexts of the 1990s which may bring other disciplinary tensions into focus. It also invites re-theorizing invention for creative pedagogies which bring together the personal, where techne connects processes of invention to processes of creating discourse. This moment of critical reflection, in turn, invites an examination of historiographic assumptions around techne, interrogating the published record for how that history has been formed and circulated for current pedagogies and theories.</p>
<p>Invention is the rhetorical cannon concerned with generating approaches to a rhetorical situation including the “habits, artistic materials, and communicative modes through which rhetorical generation occurs” (Peter Simonson 2014, 314). It is an important concept for rhetoric given its role in making epistemological claims about writing. The late Janice Lauer traces an “inventional turn” that, during the 1990s, dispersed through many sites and perspectives (2004, 96-116), away from the efforts to categorize, theorize, and test elaborated theories of process and towards the knowledges made and expressed through invention (118). Invention has often been obscured by discussions of cultural critique and postmodern theory that shifted attention in the 1990s towards issues of social construction, ideology, and the origins of language. As discussed by both Kelly Pender and Byron Hawk, Richard Young’s work in the 1970s and 1980s on process theorized the labor of rhetoric and composition to be the work of invention, broadly understood, and saw <em>techne</em> as a means of connecting invention explicitly to writing (Hawk 2007, 27; Pender 2011, 39). Additionally, as Pender argues, invention and techne have been closely aligned within rhetoric and composition scholarship, shaping theory, practice, and pedagogies within the discipline while illuminating that techne is oftentimes under-theorized and under-utilized in that same scholarship (Pender 2011, 12).</p>
<h2><em>Techne</em></h2>
<p><em>Techne</em> is a concept from rhetorical studies that Aristotle defines as “the art and craft” of rhetoric. He argues that techne is a concept that helps us understand many human activities from rhetoric, to medicine, to arts and crafts. He compares work with rhetoric to that of a skilled artisan such as a potter. He argues that there are fundamental craft skills to master in order to perform rhetoric, but that there is also an intrinsic artistic element to it. Not only is there a transferable and learnable skill to rhetoric, but it can also transcend to the nature of art when done well. Techne also provides for an understanding of everyday rhetorical action and extraordinary rhetorical action.</p>
<p><em>Techne</em> helps scholars understand what the material of rhetoric is, conceive of how it is shaped and molded, and to consider how to best teach the practice of rhetoric. Since Aristotle <em>techne</em> has been theorized and defined in a multitude of different ways, but all with a focus on the activity of rhetoric. Kelly Pender, in her 2011 book Techne: From Neoclassicism to Postmodernism suggests 5 composite definitions of techne “cluster(ed) around (…) epistemological and axiological positions” (16).</p>
<ol>
<li>A “how-to” guide or handbook</li>
<li>A rational ability to effect a useful result</li>
<li>Means of inventing new social possibilities</li>
<li>A means of producing resources</li>
<li>Non-instrumental mode of bringing-forth</li>
</ol>
<p>The in-betweenness that <em>techne</em> inhabits highlights explicit convergences of imagination and rhetorical practice inherent with acts of creation can be understood not as serendipity experienced by a certain few, but as a practice that can be learned, revised, recalled, and utilized (Pender 2011, 141). Additionally, as both Pender and Lauer have indicated, tensions between theories of invention and techne have left material traces within the scholarship and practices of rhetoric and composition.</p>
